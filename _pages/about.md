# About me

I am a PhD candidate in Computational Biology at the [Center for Computational Molecular Biology at Brown](https://ccmb.brown.edu) specializing in the development of artificial intelligence (AI) models for complex biomedical data. My work focuses on integrating high-dimensional omics and clinical data to address real-world problems such as drug resistance, cancer evolution, and infectious disease dynamics. I collaborate closely with domain experts to translate biological questions into robust AI systems that produce actionable insights for biotechnology and public-health applications. 

## Education
I have over seven years of research training, advised by:
- Dr. Lorin Crawford ([Microsoft Research] (http://www.lcrawlab.com/) and Brown University)
- Dr. Jeffrey Bailey ([Center for Computational Biology, Brown University](https://baileylab.org/)).
- Dr. Ashley Conard ([Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/ashleyconard/))
- Dr. Mary L. Gray ([Microsoft Research](https://marylgray.org/))
- Dr. Franziska Michor ([Department of Data Science, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute](http://michorlab.dfci.harvard.edu/))
- Dr. Simona Cristea ([Department of Data Science, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute](https://labs.dana-farber.org/aguirrelab/people/simona-cristea-phd))

I graduated from Boston University's College of Engineering with a Bachelor of Science in Biomedical Engineering in 2022 and a concentration in machine learning. There, my senior thesis was awarded the "Societal Impact Award". I started my PhD in Computational Biology at Brown University in 2022, advised by [Dr. Lorin Crawford](http://www.lcrawlab.com/) and [Dr. Jeffrey Bailey](https://baileylab.org/). During the summer of 2025, I was a Research Intern at Microsoft Research New England working with [Dr. Lorin Crawford](http://www.lcrawlab.com/), [Dr. Ashley Conard](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/ashleyconard/) and [Dr. Mary L. Gray](https://marylgray.org/).

# Key research projects

## A Statistical and Machine Learning Approach to Investigating Unmapped Regions of the Malaria Parasite Genome
While the malaria parasite's genome (*Plasmodium falciparum*) shows limited overall genetic variation, much of it is concentrated in highly dynamic subtelomeric regions. These regions encode genes that help the parasite evade human immunity, making them crucial for its survival. I am developing an AI-driven framework that leverages statistical methods and Variational Autoencoders to analyze these challenging genomic regions. This approach aims to uncover their role in shaping parasite population structure and identify shared genetic variants across populations. Insights from this research could improve our understanding of malaria progression and guide the development of novel drug targets.

## Bayesian Mixed-Effects Modeling for Drug-Resistance Forecasting
Built a scalable, interpretable Bayesian modeling pipeline to estimate and predict the spatial spread and selection of drug-resistance mutations using genomic surveillance data collected across regions and time. The framework leverages partial pooling and hierarchical structure to handle sparse and noisy observations while producing calibrated uncertainty estimates suitable for downstream decision support.

The project emphasizes model transparency and interpretability, enabling stakeholders to understand mutation-specific drivers, regional heterogeneity, and forecast uncertainty rather than relying on black-box predictions. Development was carried out in close collaboration with biologists and public-health researchers, ensuring that model assumptions aligned with domain knowledge and that outputs were actionable in real-world monitoring workflows.

## Pancancer evolutionary model analyzing scRNAseq data
While at Dana-Farber, I developed an evolutionary modeling framework aimed at characterizing the progression of cancer across various tumor types. This project focused on analyzing copy number variations from single-cell RNA sequencing data to estimate distinct evolutionary modes in tumors. By applying machine learning techniques, the model identified patterns of clonal evolution and adaptive mechanisms used by cancer cells, providing valuable insights into tumor heterogeneity. The findings contributed to a better understanding of how tumors evolve over time and respond to different treatment pressures.
